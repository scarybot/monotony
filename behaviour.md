When it's possible to buy a property:
	- I will always buy if I already own one or more of the set (100%)
	- I will probably buy if nobody yet owns any of this set (75%)
	- I am less likely to buy if another player already owns one of the set (50%)

When it's possible to unmortgage one of my properties:
	- I will always unmortgage something if it's part of a completed set I own
	- I will always unmortgage something if its unmortgage cost is less than 15% of my cash

When it's possible to buy a house:
	- I will spend up to 40% of my cash per turn buying houses where possible.

When it's possible to buy a hotel:
	- I will always buy a hotel where possible, provided it costs less than 40% of my cash. (Stacks with house-buying, up to a maximum of 80% of my cash per turn on property)

When I'm unable to pay a debt from cash in hand, I will sell assets in the following order:
	- Hotels
	- Houses
	- Mortgage non-set property
	- Mortgage railway station
	- Mortgage set property

When I'm in jail and I have a get-out-of-jail-free card:
	- I will use the jail card to go free, unless less than 50% of the completed sets on the board are owned by me, in which case I'll bide my time.

When considering offering to buy a property from another player:
	- The chance I will do this depends on what percentage of the set I already own.
	- I am more likely to propose a trade the closer I am to GO.
	- I am more likely to propose a trade the longer the game has been running.
	- I am more likely to propose a trade the more cash I have (maximum chance if over £1000)
	- I will get bored and trade anything at 100 turns.
	- My offer will be based on these factors and the amount of cash I have in hand.

When considering whether or not to accept a trade from another player:
	- I am more likely to accept a trade the longer the game has been running.
	- I will get bored and accept any trade at 100 turns.
	- I am more likely to accept a trade if it is far over the list price.
	- I am more likely to accept a trade if I am low on cash. (No effect if I have more than £1000)
	- There is an additional random element to reperesent my 'mood'.
